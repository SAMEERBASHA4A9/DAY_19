In ORDER BASED Instantiation 
In the TB we connected interface with different signals
for a we connected c, for b we connected b, and for c we connected a
so if you calculated the output according to rtl 
d=a+b, but we got b+c because we connected c for a and b for b 
so we got 10 insted of 1100(a+b)

In NAME BASED Instantiation 
we got the correct ouputs because in name based instantiation we connected each and every signal by its name
so there is no chance of signal missmatching,

Generally coders prefer name based instantiation in order to reduce the confusion
